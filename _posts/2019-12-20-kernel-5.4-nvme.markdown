title: Kernel 5.4 Can't Read NVMe Partitions
categories: Broken
---

Strike three for Kernel 5.4: it won't read the partitions of some NVMe drives that do not strictly adhere to the NVMe specification.

## State

{{ page.categories[0] }}.

A fixing patch has landed in 5.5-rc2 and will be backported to 5.4. Just wait.

## Workarounds

- Downgrade kernel to < 5.4

## Tracked elsewhere

- Kernel.org: <https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=205679>
