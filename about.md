[Arch Linux] is a [rolling release] Linux distro. It delivers the
latest-and-greatest software to its users at a nice pace. However,
living on the bleeding edge isn't without its drawbacks:
things can and will be broken.

This site tries to document recent breakage for common Arch Linux users.

For any feedback, please open an issue in [the project's issue tracker][issues].
